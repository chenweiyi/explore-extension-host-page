## GitHub File Format Instructions

In your GitHub repository, prepare a `.json` file, for example: `bookmark.json`, and add content similar to the following:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Google",
    "url": "https://www.google.com",
    "tags": ["google", "search"]
  },
  {
    "title": "GitHub",
    "url": "https://github.com",
    "tags": ["github", "code"]
  }
]
```

The above JSON file is just an example, and you can configure any websites you want to add.

| :---- | :------------------- |
